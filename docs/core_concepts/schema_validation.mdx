# Schema Validation

This page explains how schema validation works in Windmill.

## Overview

Schema validation ensures that data conforms to a predefined structure. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring smooth operation of scripts and flows that rely on specific input formats. Windmill leverages schema validation in several key areas, including script input arguments, resource definitions, and flow inputs/outputs.

## How it works

Windmill primarily uses JSON Schema to define and validate data structures. When you define input parameters for a script, or the structure for a resource type, you are often implicitly or explicitly creating a JSON Schema.

-   **Script Inputs:** When a script is executed, Windmill can validate the provided arguments against the schema defined for that script. This helps catch errors early and provides clear feedback to the user.
-   **Resource Types:** Custom resource types can have a defined schema, ensuring that all resources of that type adhere to a consistent structure.
-   **Flow Inputs/Outputs:** Schemas can be defined for the overall inputs and outputs of a flow, as well as for individual steps, ensuring data consistency throughout the execution of a flow.

If validation fails, Windmill will typically raise an error, preventing the script or flow from proceeding with invalid data.

## Use Cases

-   **Ensuring correct script invocation:** Prevent runtime errors by validating script arguments before execution.
-   **Standardizing resource configurations:** Maintain consistency across different instances of a resource type.
-   **Building robust data pipelines:** Guarantee that data passed between flow steps conforms to expected formats.
-   **Improving App UIs:** Auto-generated UIs for scripts and apps benefit from schemas to provide appropriate input fields and validation.

## Best Practices

-   **Be specific but not overly restrictive:** Define schemas that accurately represent your data requirements without making them unnecessarily complex.
-   **Use descriptive titles and descriptions:** Make your schemas easier to understand for other users (and your future self).
-   **Leverage schema reuse:** For common data structures, consider defining them once and referencing them in multiple places.
-   **Test your schemas:** Ensure your schemas correctly validate expected data and reject invalid data.
